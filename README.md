## Description

Our project’s primary goal is finding the faulty street light, since in the absence of proper lighting, some of the rural areas become unsafe for people at night especially for elders, women, and children. Our project provides a automated feedback system based on a software that allows the service engineers to know the exact location of non-functional streetlights in their areas of responsibility.

- The entire project is in the form of a simulation. So we can see how the entire process works.
- This is useful since we can make changes in design and see them work, so its a real time prototype.

## Technology stack

Tools and technologies that you learnt and used in the project.

1. Proteus 8
2. Arduino IDE

## Project Setup

> Steps for project setup are as follows:

- Install Proteus 8.
- Install Arduino Module and Rf Module in proteus.
- Install Arduino IDE, since for the Arduino module to run on proteus, it needs the hexfile of the Arduino code which we supply using Arduino IDE.

## Usage

> Steps to run your project once its setup.

- Step 1: Download the proteus and Arduino files from this github repositoy.
- Step 2: Open the proteus file in Proteus 8.
- Step 3: Open the Arduino code in Arduino IDE and compile the Arduino code.
- Step 4: Now export compiled binary which is present under the sketch tab in Arduino IDE (We have also provided the hexfile in github repo for easy access).
- Step 5: On the proteus GUI, double click on the Arduino and add the hexfile as the program file
- Step 6: Now run the simulation and slide the lamps so that the intensity changes on the LDR's.
- This change in intensity will give the exact latitude and longitude of the electric pole as the output.

## Applications

- Street light are one of the most important element in public safety. Detecting a non-working street lights till now was a manual process which main depends on human feedback(damage of the street light was observed by getting the complaints from the colony/street people).
- But using our automated feedback system the engineer will directly get the location of the faulted streetlight instantly in google maps. So the repairing work would start as soon as possible.
- Further it will also help consumers to see the working of the streetlight in dangerous or unknown areas and plan their journey also. Accidents will also reduce if the driver knows the functionality of the streetlight in the area he is going

## Future scope

- The current lighting system directly send the location only to the software which is only accessible by the system engineer only. But in future we can make the software available for the consumers also so that they will also be able to check the non functional streetlight in their areas.
- This system can form the base for a full automated streetlight which can do fault detection as well as troubleshooting itself.
- The application can further include consumer feedback of streetlight and also check the intensity of streetlight and determine the time of replacing the streetlight earlier before it becomes dead.
